          Welcome to <strong>Fleurè</strong>, a brand born from passion,
          creativity and a dedication to excellence. My name is Haseeb, and I’ve
          been fortunate enough to turn my childhood passion into a thriving
          business. At just 12 years old, I started with balloon styling, and
          over the years, I expanded my services to fill-scale event planning.
          With over 6 years of experience in event management, florists, and
          personalised balloon creations. I know it was time to give my two
          passions - events and florals - the individual attention they
          deserved.
        </p>
        <p className="my-story-text">
          Previously, I ran both my event planning and floral services under the
          same page, <strong> Events by Haseeb</strong>, but I realised each
          deserved its own focus and platform. That’s when{" "}
          <strong>Fleurè</strong> was born. <strong>Fleurè</strong> is dedicated
          to providing bespoke flower bouquets and personalised balloon
          services, available nationwide across the UK, while my event planning
          continues through <strong> Events by Haseeb</strong>, where I deliver
          unforgettable event experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="my-story-text">
          This is just the beginning of <strong>Fleurè</strong>, and I cannot
          wait to see where the journey takes me. Every opportunity, connection,
          and experience will help shape the future of <strong>Fleurè</strong>{" "}
          as I continue to grow and expand. Along the way, I’ve been honoured to
          be featured in local newspapers and was the finalist for Youngest
          Entrepreneur of the Year 2022.
        </p>
        <p className="my-story-text">
          Thank you for being part of this journey. Your support means the
          world, and I’m excited to share what’s next with you!
